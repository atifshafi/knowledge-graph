## Part I: Architecture Discovery Methodology

### RHACM Architecture Research Principles

RHACM follows a **3-level hierarchical architecture** that must be discovered and preserved:

```
Level 1: Infrastructure Foundation
├── OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
│   ├── Kubernetes API Server
│   └── etcd Cluster
└── ACM Hub Cluster

Level 1.5: Multicluster Engine Foundation (CRITICAL DISCOVERY)
└── MCE → Backplane Operator, Cluster Manager, Klusterlet, Registration Webhook

Level 2: Central Management Hub
└── Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) ← CENTRAL ROOT

Level 3: Major Subsystems (all branch from ACM)
├── Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
├── Application Lifecycle (APP)
├── Observability (OBS)
├── Cluster Lifecycle (CLUSTER)
├── Search & Discovery (SEARCH)
├── Web Console (CONSOLE)
└── Server Foundation (SERVER_FOUNDATION)

Level 4: Internal Components (~40-90 per subsystem)
├── Policy Reconcilers & Controllers
├── Internal Engines & Managers
├── Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
├── Integration Components
└── Platform Operator Integrations
```

### Critical Discovery Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

**Rule 1: Component Authenticity Verification**
- Every component MUST exist in official GitHub repositories
- ZERO fictional components allowed (especially avoid `multicloud-operators-application`)
- Use exact repository names and verified component names
- Cross-reference with multiple repository sources

**Rule 2: ACM-Centric Hub Architecture**
- ACM is the single central root node
- Connection flow: `OCP` → `HUB` → `MCE` → `ACM` → 7 subsystems
- Tree structure (organizational chart), NOT network diagram
- No isolated components or alternative root nodes

**Rule 3: Semantic Relationship Discovery**
- Research actual operational dependencies between components
- Use meaningful relationship labels: `CONTAINS`, `MANAGES`, `CONFIGURES`, `ORCHESTRATES`
- Avoid generic arrows (`-->`) wherever possible
- Relationships indicate actual operational dependencies, not just connectivity

**Rule 4: Enterprise Component Discovery**
- Basic RHACM installations miss critical enterprise features
- Must discover and include: MCE foundation, Global Hub, Submariner, Backup/Recovery, CAPI, Red Hat Insights
- Platform operator integration (AWX, GitOps, Gatekeeper) is essential for completeness

## Part III: Component Relationship Research

### Relationship Discovery Methodology

**Step 1: Internal Component Relationships**
For each discovered component, research:
1. **Controller-Reconciler Patterns**: What reconcilers does each controller contain?
2. **CRD Management**: Which controllers create/watch/update which CRDs?
3. **Addon Frameworks**: How do addons deploy and manage components?
4. **Internal Engines**: What processing engines exist within operators?

**Example Research Pattern - Governance Policy Propagator**:
```
Repository Analysis → github.com/stolostron/governance-policy-propagator
├── pkg/controllers/
│   ├── rootpolicy/ → RootPolicyReconciler
│   ├── replicatedpolicy/ → ReplicatedPolicyReconciler
│   ├── policyset/ → PolicySetReconciler
│   └── encryption/ → EncryptionKeysReconciler
├── Internal Engines:
│   ├── Status Aggregation Engine
│   ├── Template Processing Engine
│   └── Placement Binding Handler
└── Relationships:
    ├── CONTAINS → All internal reconcilers
    ├── USES → Template resolvers and encryption systems
    └── PROPAGATES_TO → governance-policy-framework
```

**Critical Relationship Discovery Patterns** (from our research):

ADDON_FRAMEWORK -->|MANAGES| MANAGEDCLUSTER_ADDON_CRD
```

**Step 2: Cross-Component Relationships**
Research operational dependencies between components:
1. **Operator Hierarchies**: Which operators deploy/manage other operators?
2. **Data Flow Patterns**: How does data flow between components?
3. **Configuration Dependencies**: Which components configure others?
4. **Integration Patterns**: How do components integrate with external systems?

**Step 3: Cross-Subsystem Relationships**
Discover how subsystems interact:
1. **Data Collection**: How does Observability collect from other subsystems?
2. **Resource Indexing**: How does Search index resources from other subsystems?
3. **UI Integration**: How does Console display data from other subsystems?
4. **Policy Enforcement**: How does Governance enforce policies across subsystems?

### Semantic Relationship Research

**ENABLES Relationships**: Research enablement patterns
- OCM enabling subsystem operators
- Foundation components enabling advanced features

**ORCHESTRATES Relationships**: Research orchestration patterns
- Higher-level controllers orchestrating lower-level components
- Workflow engines orchestrating multi-step processes

**Cross-Cluster Relationships**: Research hub-spoke communication
- Components that communicate across clusters
- Data flows from hub to managed clusters
- Policy distribution and status aggregation patterns

## Part IV: Systematic Architecture Construction

### Subsystem Construction Methodology

**Overview Subsystem Construction**:
1. **Infrastructure Foundation**: Start with OCP → K8S → etcd base
2. **MCE Foundation Layer**: Add MCE → Backplane/Cluster Manager/Klusterlet
3. **Central Hub**: Place ACM as central root connected to MCE
4. **Subsystem Branches**: Connect all 7 subsystems to ACM
5. **Enterprise Extensions**: Add Global Hub, Submariner, Backup/Recovery
6. **Platform Integration**: Add AWX, GitOps, Gatekeeper operators
7. **Foundation Components**: Add all server foundation components
8. **Cross-Integration**: Add CAPI and Red Hat Insights components

**Per-Subsystem Construction Process**:
1. **Core Components**: Start with main operators/controllers from repository research
2. **Internal Architecture**: Add all discovered internal components (reconcilers, engines, managers)
3. **CRD Integration**: Add all Custom Resource Definitions and their relationships
4. **External Dependencies**: Connect to foundation and platform components
5. **Cross-Subsystem**: Add relationships to other subsystems (avoid duplication)

### Component Verification Process

**Authenticity Verification**:
1. **Repository Verification**: Every component must exist in official GitHub repositories
2. **Documentation Cross-Check**: Verify component existence in multiple sources
3. **API Version Verification**: Ensure CRDs have proper API versions
4. **Controller Verification**: Confirm controller existence in repository code

**Relationship Verification**:
1. **Operational Dependency Check**: Ensure relationships reflect actual operational dependencies
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Verify relationship labels match actual component interactions
3. **Hierarchy Compliance**: Ensure ACM-centric hierarchy is maintained
4. **Cross-Subsystem Logic**: Verify cross-subsystem relationships make operational sense

### Architecture Validation Rules

**Connectivity Validation**:
- Every component must trace back to ACM through valid relationship paths
- No isolated component clusters
- All enterprise features properly integrated
- Platform operators properly connected via PROVIDES_PLATFORM_FOR

**Completeness Validation**:
- All major RHACM features represented
- Internal architecture exposed (not just operator level)
- Cross-subsystem integration patterns implemented
- Enterprise components included (MCE, Global Hub, Submariner, Backup, CAPI, Insights)

**Relationship Validation**:
- Semantic relationships throughout (minimal generic arrows)
- Cross-cluster relationships properly marked
- Component reuse instead of duplication
- Proper operational dependency representation

---

## Part V: Critical Warnings & Error Prevention

### Architecture Violation Warnings

**WARNING 1: Isolated Component Clusters**
- **Symptom**: Components not connected to main ACM hierarchy
- **Root Cause**: Missing OCM enablement or ACM subsystem connections
- **Prevention**: Always trace connection path from ACM to every component

**WARNING 2: Wrong Central Hub Architecture**
- **Symptom**: Subsystems not properly connected to central ACM hub
- **Root Cause**: Misunderstanding hierarchical vs network architecture
- **Prevention**: Maintain ACM as single central root with subsystem branches

**WARNING 3: Fictional Component Creation**
- **Symptom**: Components that don't exist in official repositories
- **Root Cause**: Making assumptions about component existence
- **Prevention**: Verify EVERY component against GitHub repositories

**WARNING 4: Console Architecture Duplication**
- **Symptom**: Creating new components when existing ones can be reused
- **Root Cause**: Not checking existing graph for reusable components
- **Prevention**: Always search existing components before creating new ones

### Critical Error Patterns to Avoid

**ERROR PATTERN 1: Generic Relationship Usage**
- **Issue**: Using `-->` arrows without semantic meaning
- **Solution**: Research actual component interactions for proper relationship labels

**ERROR PATTERN 2: Platform Hierarchy Violations**
- **Issue**: Resources directly connected to platform instead of operators
- **Solution**: Follow OCP → Operator → Controller → CRD hierarchy

**ERROR PATTERN 3: Missing Enterprise Components**
- **Issue**: Basic RHACM architecture without enterprise features
- **Solution**: Research and include MCE, Global Hub, Submariner, Backup, CAPI, Insights

**ERROR PATTERN 4: Cross-Subsystem Duplication**
- **Issue**: Creating duplicate components instead of cross-subsystem references
- **Solution**: Use component reuse patterns with cross-subsystem relationships

### Verification Checklist

Before finalizing architecture:

✅ **Connectivity Check**: Every component traces back to ACM
✅ **Component Verification**: All components exist in GitHub repositories  
✅ **Relationship Semantics**: No generic arrows, all relationships labeled
✅ **Duplication Check**: No duplicate components across subsystems
✅ **Enterprise Completeness**: MCE, Global Hub, Submariner, Backup, CAPI, Insights included
✅ **Cross-Subsystem Integration**: Proper component reuse patterns implemented
✅ **Foundation Layers**: OCM and multicloud-operators-foundation properly distinguished
✅ **Target Metrics**: 291 components, 419 relationships achieved

- `mermaid/rhacm-overview.mmd` - High-level hierarchical architecture
- `mermaid/rhacm-governance.mmd` - GRC subsystem with internal components
- `mermaid/rhacm-application.mmd` - Application lifecycle with three models
- `mermaid/rhacm-observability.mmd` - Monitoring and metrics pipeline
- `mermaid/rhacm-cluster.mmd` - Cluster management and HyperShift
- `mermaid/rhacm-search.mmd` - Resource discovery and indexing
- `mermaid/rhacm-console.mmd` - Web console and plugin architecture

**File Structure Pattern**:
```mermaid
graph TB
    %% Core [Subsystem] Components (Real Components)
    [List all main operators/controllers from repository research]
    
    %% [Category] Internal Components (Detailed)
    [List all internal reconcilers, engines, managers discovered]
    
    %% [Category] CRDs (Complete)
    [List all Custom Resource Definitions]
    
    %% Internal Architecture
    [Main_Component] -->|CONTAINS| [Internal_Component]
    
    %% Cross-Component Relationships  
    [Component_A] -->|SEMANTIC_LABEL| [Component_B]
    
    %% Foundation Integration
    OCM -->|ENABLES| [Subsystem_Main_Operator]
```

### Neo4j Import Process

**Import Methods**:
1. **Copy-Paste Method**: Copy entire cypher file content to Neo4j Browser
2. **Command Line Method**: Use cypher-shell with file input
3. **Verification Queries**: Run component count and relationship validation

**Post-Import Verification**:
```cypher
-- Verify component count
MATCH (n:RHACMComponent) RETURN count(n) as TotalComponents;
-- Expected: 291

-- Verify relationship count  
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r) as TotalRelationships;
-- Expected: 419

-- Verify ACM central hub
MATCH (acm {id: 'ACM'})-[r]->(subsystem) 
RETURN acm.label, type(r), subsystem.label ORDER BY subsystem.label;
-- Expected: ACM connected to 7 subsystems

-- Verify no fictional components
MATCH (n:RHACMComponent) WHERE n.id = "MULTICLOUD_OPS_APPLICATION"
RETURN count(n) as FictionalComponents;
-- Expected: 0
```
